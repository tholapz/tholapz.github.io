# Prologue - A Life in Transition

The decision had been coming for months, perhaps even years, but the final moment came suddenly, like a deep dive into the unknown. It was a Tuesday morning in October 2023 when Kamol sat at his desk, staring at the familiar screen of his Apple workstation. The return-to-office email blinked in his inbox, and he knew—he wasn’t going back. Not to the office, not to the job, not to the life he had been living for the past six years.

He took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision settle over him. For the first time in a long time, it didn’t feel like a decision made for survival or financial gain, but for himself. The world outside his window was still and quiet, a stark contrast to the noise in his head. His mind drifted back to the ocean, to the depths where everything seemed so simple, so peaceful. There, underwater, it was just him and his breath. No bosses, no deadlines, no emails demanding answers.

Leaving Apple was terrifying. The company had doubled his salary when he joined in 2017, offering him what felt like a golden ticket to financial security. But beneath that security, Kamol had started to feel something gnawing at him—an emptiness that no paycheck could fill. The pace at Apple was slow, bureaucratic, and stifling, with decisions handed down from the top and little room for innovation. Kamol could see the cracks forming early, especially when his proposals to modernize the outdated codebase were met with resistance.

He had weathered the frustrations, pushed forward, and told himself it was just part of the job. But when COVID-19 hit, stripping away the distractions of travel, dining out, and a life lived at the surface, Kamol was forced to face himself. The realization was brutal: if he died tomorrow, who would even notice? His family lived on the other side of the world, and his days had become a monotonous pursuit of financial gain, devoid of personal meaning.

It was during this time that he found the ocean again. Scuba diving had been a hobby, but it became much more—an escape, a refuge. He signed up for dive master training, knowing it would challenge him in ways he had avoided his entire adult life. The training was grueling: up at 5 AM, hours spent at sea, dealing with a parade of customers, some easy-going, others difficult. But every time Kamol slipped into the water, it was like shedding the weight of his worries. Beneath the waves, the world was quiet, and he found peace in the stillness.

The ocean had taught him something important—how to stand his ground and be present in the moment. Above water, life was full of uncertainties he couldn’t control, but underwater, he found clarity. And that clarity helped him make the decision to walk away from the corporate grind, no matter how frightening it seemed.

As he clicked “send” on his resignation, Kamol felt a wave of liberation wash over him. It wasn’t just the act of leaving a job; it was the realization that he could finally live life on his own terms. For the first time in years, the path ahead wasn’t laid out by someone else—it was his to forge.
