I have to write this down, otherwise I might go insane.

I believe startup founders are insane by nature.

When you have a vision of what could be that nobody else can see, that's borderline delusional.

I have a hypothesis I want proven wrong: There exists a business in this world that can be fully automated by off-the-shelf AI system.

This is very hard to prove.

I can make a dating app, it should be possible to have minimal human intervention.

I can make a hotel management system. Or tour guide company. This should work with the florishing gig economy worker.

I feel like a headless chicken, run around without plan or purpose. and I'm not dead either. A zombie, headless chicken. Basically, I think I can do more with what I have. And I've been doing less, hence the misery.

I think I can build a startup (hard but possible), without any experience (again, still doable), in Thailand (quite questionable), all by myself (even more questionable).
